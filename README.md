MobX Tutorial by Leigh Halliday


You might be wondering, why did I do MobX tutorial and why am I learning it?
Well, I applied for a job opening, expecting I won't get any response, I did get
response this morning. They want me to do a little project which is fairly normal.

Among things I need to do is, use MobX as State managment and any of the 
available REST API services, like Firebase, Basic Dynamic Resources etc etc.

Well, I did get familiar with MobX, but I would like to do at least one more tutorial 
for MobX and then go and learn how to use Firebase.

So, onward to another MobX tutorial!
